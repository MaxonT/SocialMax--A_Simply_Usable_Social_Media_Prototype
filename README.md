📝 Reflection

The Change++ challenge was a rollercoaster. I totally broke my project a few times, got lost in Git trees. But somehow, after all the crashes and confusion, things finally came together. I actually learned a lot about debugging, file structure, and just pushing through when stuff doesn’t work. It felt pretty good to see it running—even if the journey was pure chaos.
